# Branch-Based Access Control Fix

## Problem Summary

The original issue was that managers and staff could see users (staff and members) from branches they weren't assigned to, violating the intended branch-based access control.

## Root Cause

The `getUsersByTenant` method in the backend only filtered by `tenantId` but did not implement branch-based filtering for MANAGER and STAFF roles. This meant:

1. **Managers** could see all users across all branches in their tenant
2. **Staff** could see all users across all branches in their tenant 
3. Only the `getExpiringMembersOverview` method had proper branch-based filtering

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fixes

#### A. Enhanced `getUsersByTenant` Method
- Added `requestingUserId` and `requestingUserRole` parameters to filters
- Implemented branch-based filtering logic for MANAGER and STAFF roles:
  - **For Staff/Managers**: Only shows users who have branch assignments in branches the requesting user has access to
  - **For Gym Members**: Only shows members who have active subscriptions in branches the requesting user has access to
  - **For OWNER and SUPER_ADMIN**: No branch restrictions (existing behavior preserved)

#### B. Updated User Controller
- Modified both `findAll` and `getByTenant` endpoints to pass requesting user context
- Added validation to prevent OWNERs from calling `getAllUsers` without `tenantId`

### 2. Frontend Components

#### A. Branch Assignment Badge Component
Created a new UI component (`BranchAssignmentBadge`) that clearly displays:
- User's branch assignments with visual badges
- Access levels (Full Access, Manager Access, Staff Access) 
- Primary branch indicators
- Detailed tooltips showing all branch assignments
- Warning indicators for users with no branch assignments

#### B. Branch Access Summary Component
- Compact display of branch access information
- Highlights primary branch assignments
- Shows warnings for users without branch assignments

### 3. Database Validation

#### A. Branch Assignment Check Script
- Created diagnostic script to verify current user-branch assignments
- Confirmed all managers and staff have proper branch assignments in the database

#### B. Branch Filtering Test Scripts
- Created test scripts to verify the branch-based filtering logic works correctly
- Confirmed that users can only see data from their assigned branches

## Current State (After Fix)

âœ… **Branch assignments are correctly configured** in the database:
- All managers have explicit branch assignments
- All staff have explicit branch assignments  
- Each user has 1-2 branch assignments with appropriate access levels

âœ… **Backend filtering is working correctly**:
- `getExpiringMembersOverview`: Already had proper branch filtering âœ“
- `getUsersByTenant`: Now has proper branch filtering âœ“
- Controllers pass requesting user context for proper filtering âœ“

âœ… **Test results confirm proper filtering**:
- Kevin Trainer (STAFF) can see 3 staff members from his assigned branches and 4 gym members
- Sarah Manager (MANAGER) can see 1 staff member from her branches and 7 gym members
- Carlos Instructor (STAFF) can see 1 staff member from his single branch and 3 gym members

## Implementation Examples

### Backend Usage (Updated Controller)
```typescript
@Get('tenant/:tenantId')
getByTenant(
  @Req() req: any,
  @Param('tenantId') tenantId: string,
  @Query('role') role?: string,
  // ... other params
) {
  const filters = {
    role: role as Role,
    // ... other filters
    requestingUserId: req.user?.id,      // NEW: Pass requesting user
    requestingUserRole: req.user?.role   // NEW: Pass requesting user role
  };
  return this.usersService.getUsersByTenant(tenantId, filters);
}
```

### Frontend Usage (New Component)
```tsx
import { BranchAssignmentBadge, BranchAccessSummary } from '@/components/ui/branch-assignment-badge'

// In staff list or member list
<BranchAssignmentBadge 
  assignments={user.userBranches}
  userRole={user.role}
  variant="compact"
/>

// In user profile or detailed view  
<BranchAccessSummary 
  assignments={user.userBranches}
  userRole={user.role}
/>
```

## Next Steps for Integration

### 1. Update Frontend Pages
The branch filtering is now working on the backend, but the frontend pages should be updated to:

1. **Staff Page** (`frontend/app/(main)/staff/page.tsx`):
   - Add `BranchAssignmentBadge` to show each staff member's branch assignments
   - Pass requesting user context in API calls

2. **Members Page** (`frontend/app/(main)/members/page.tsx`):
   - Add branch assignment display for gym members
   - Show which branch each member belongs to

3. **User Profile/Details**: 
   - Display branch assignments prominently
   - Show access level and primary branch information

### 2. Frontend API Calls
Update API hooks to pass requesting user context:

```typescript
// Update useUsersByTenant hook
export function useUsersByTenant(tenantId: string, params?: UserQueryParams) {
  const { data: profile } = useProfile() // Get current user
  
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: userKeys.byTenant(tenantId, params),
    queryFn: () => usersApi.getByTenant(tenantId, {
      ...params,
      requestingUserId: profile?.id,     // Pass requesting user info
      requestingUserRole: profile?.role  
    }),
    enabled: !!tenantId && !!profile?.id
  })
}
```

### 3. UI Improvements
- Add branch filter dropdowns that show only accessible branches
- Display "filtered view" indicators when branch-based filtering is active
- Add branch assignment management interface for admins

## Testing & Verification

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test the branch filtering logic
cd backend && node test-updated-filtering.js

# Verify branch assignments  
cd backend && node check-assignments.js
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Login as different users (managers, staff) using the dev login page
2. Navigate to Staff and Members pages
3. Verify that only users from assigned branches are visible
4. Check that branch assignments are clearly displayed in the UI

## Security Notes

- âœ… Branch-based access control is now enforced at the backend level
- âœ… Frontend UI cannot bypass backend restrictions
- âœ… All user role types (SUPER_ADMIN, OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF) have appropriate access levels
- âœ… Users without branch assignments show warning indicators
- âœ… Primary branch assignments are clearly identified
