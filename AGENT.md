## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Agent Rules & Development Guidelines

### ü§ñ Agent Behavior Rules
- **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE MAKING CHANGES**: Never modify files, run commands, or make schema changes without explicit user approval first
- **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING**: Ask clarifying questions if the request is ambiguous
- **EXPLAIN CHANGES**: When proposing changes, clearly explain what will be modified and why
- **PRESERVE USER CONTROL**: The user must approve every change to maintain their ability to follow along
- **LOCAL DEVELOPMENT**: User runs backend at 5000 and frontend at 3000 - Agent doesn't need to run unless rebuilding
- **FILE CHANGE INDICATION**: Use **bold** or *italics* for file changes to distinguish from thinking
- **NO CONSOLE LOG SPAM**: Remove debug console logs after fixing issues - keep code clean
- **CONSISTENT QUERY KEYS**: Always match React Query keys between hooks and mutations for proper cache invalidation

### üèóÔ∏è Code Quality Rules
- **SOLID, DRY, YAGNI Principles**: Always implement best programming practices
- **Schema Updates**: Every modification in schema MUST update the seeder and run the seeder to maintain data consistency
- **Seeder Maintenance**: When adding new schema fields or changing existing structures, always update `/backend/prisma/seed.js` to include the new fields with appropriate default values
- **Port Consistency**: Always run frontend on 3000 and backend on 5000 for local development. No other ports (3001, 5001, etc.)
- **Build Verification**: Check functionality by building Next.js or Nest.js using their build scripts
- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **React Query**: Properly handle cache invalidation, loading states, and error states
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing and resolve compilation errors

### üö´ DATABASE MIGRATION RULES

**CRITICAL: NO MIGRATIONS DURING DEVELOPMENT**
- ‚úÖ **Use `prisma db push` ONLY** for all schema changes during development
- ‚ùå **DO NOT use migrations** until MVP production launch
- **Reason**: We're rapidly iterating on schema and features
- **Production**: Will create proper migrations once MVP is finalized

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use for development
npx prisma db push

# ‚ùå WRONG - Don't use until production
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Schema Change Workflow:**
1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npx prisma db push`
3. Update seeders if schema changes affect seeding
4. Run seeders to maintain updated data
5. Test changes thoroughly
6. Commit to git

## üîß RBAC Use Cases & Implementation

### Global Roles (Platform-Level)
- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full platform access, all tenants, system administration
- **OWNER**: Full tenant access, all branches, user management, billing
- **MANAGER**: Branch-specific management, staff supervision, client management
- **STAFF**: Limited operations, client check-in, basic client administration

- **GYM_TRAINER**: Member training, workout plans, progress tracking
- **GYM_FRONT_DESK**: Member check-in, basic administration
- **GYM_MAINTENANCE**: Equipment maintenance, facility management

### Access Patterns
- **Owner Access**: All branches within their tenant ‚úÖ
- **Manager Access**: Assigned branches only (via GymUserBranch table) ‚úÖ
- **Staff Access**: Assigned branches only (via GymUserBranch table) ‚úÖ
- **Client Access**: Their own profile and assigned branches ‚úÖ

### RBAC Implementation Status
- **Global Roles**: SUPER_ADMIN, OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF, CLIENT ‚úÖ
- **Business Roles**: GYM_MEMBER, GYM_TRAINER, etc. ‚úÖ

- **Role Assignment**: CLIENT global role for all end users, business-specific roles in profiles

### Multi-Role User Support
- **Architecture**: Users can have CLIENT global role + OWNER/MANAGER/STAFF permissions
- **Use Case**: Gym owner who is also a member tracking their own fitness data
- **Implementation**: Single login, separate contexts for admin vs member features
- **No Conflicts**: Clean role separation prevents permission issues

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### **Current Setup**
- **Frontend**: Runs on port 3000 (User manages `npm run dev`)
- **Backend**: Runs on port 5000 (User manages `npm run start:dev`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- **Environment**: Linux (Pop!_OS) development environment
- **Agent Role**: Agent handles builds/testing only, user manages servers

### **üö´ DATABASE MIGRATION RULES**

**CRITICAL: NO MIGRATIONS DURING DEVELOPMENT**
- ‚úÖ **Use `prisma db push` ONLY** for all schema changes during development
- ‚ùå **DO NOT use migrations** until MVP production launch
- **Reason**: We're rapidly iterating on schema and features
- **Production**: Will create proper migrations once MVP is finalized

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use for development
npx prisma db push

# ‚ùå WRONG - Don't use until production
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Schema Change Workflow:**
1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npx prisma db push`
3. Update seeders if schema changes affect seeding
4. Run seeders to maintain updated data
5. Test changes thoroughly
6. Commit to git

### **Port Standards**
- **Frontend**: Always port 3000 (never 3001, 3002, etc.)
- **Backend**: Always port 5000 (never 5001, 5002, etc.)
- **Consistency**: No alternative ports to avoid confusion

## Development Environment

### Quick Start (Host-Based Development)
```bash
# Database in Docker, Frontend/Backend on host
./scripts/dev-start.sh

# Or manual 3-terminal setup
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres
cd backend && npm run start:dev
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Port Management
- **Frontend**: Always run on port 3000. Kill any process using it if needed.
- **Backend**: Always run on port 5000. Kill any process using it if needed.

### Production Infrastructure
- **Backend**: Railway.com (‚Ç±250/month) - NestJS + PostgreSQL (149+ seeded users)
- **Frontend**: Vercel.com (free) - Next.js with SSR compatibility
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL with business units and gym subscriptions
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for member photos
- **Total Cost**: ‚Ç±250/month (bootstrap-friendly)
- **URLs**: https://happy-respect-production.up.railway.app (backend), Vercel deployment (frontend)

## Code Style Guidelines

### Backend (NestJS/TypeScript)
- **Imports**: NestJS imports first, then relative imports
- **Naming**: PascalCase for classes/services, camelCase for methods/properties
- **Error handling**: Use NestJS exceptions (BadRequestException, NotFoundException, etc.)
- **DTOs**: Use class-validator decorators and class-transformer
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript with some relaxed rules (noImplicitAny: false)
- **Formatting**: Single quotes, trailing commas (Prettier)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, semantic table naming (GymMemberSubscription)

### Frontend (Next.js/React/TypeScript)
- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **Imports**: Use path aliases (@/*)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with class-variance-authority
- **State**: Zustand stores for business logic, React Query for server state
- **UI**: Radix UI components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Performance**: Zustand stores eliminate re-render loops (< 3 renders per operation)
- **SSR Compatibility**: Client components for third-party libraries (react-toastify)
- **API Structure**: Business-specific endpoints (`/api/v1/gym/users/*`, `/api/v1/gym/members/*`, `/api/v1/business-units/*`)

### General
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules (ignore during builds for MVP)
- **Formatting**: Prettier (single quotes, trailing commas)
- **No comments**: Avoid adding comments unless explicitly requested
- **Security**: Never expose secrets, use environment variables
- **API Structure**: Business-specific endpoints (`/api/v1/gym/users/*`, `/api/v1/gym/members/*`, `/api/v1/business-units/*`)
- **Database**: Multi-tenant with business units (shared schema, tenant isolation)
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control (SUPER_ADMIN, OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF, CLIENT)

### **Testing Checklist**
- ‚úÖ Create new membership plans
- ‚úÖ Edit existing plans with pre-populated data
- ‚úÖ Toggle plan status (activate/deactivate)
- ‚úÖ Delete plans (with conflict detection)
- ‚úÖ Philippine peso display throughout UI
- ‚úÖ Member count accuracy

## üìù Code Standards Applied

- **SOLID Principles**: Applied in service layer design
- **DRY**: Currency utilities reused across components
- **YAGNI**: Removed unnecessary average price feature
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing with proper error handling
- **Philippine Localization**: Consistent ‚Ç± currency formatting

### **Development Standards**
- **Clean Code**: Remove debug console logs from production
- **Error Handling**: Keep proper error logging, remove debugging noise
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any` types, use proper interfaces
- **React Query**: Proper error handling and loading states
- **Build Quality**: Always ensure frontend and backend build successfully
  - Next.js: `npm run build` for production readiness
  - NestJS: `npm run build` for TypeScript compilation
