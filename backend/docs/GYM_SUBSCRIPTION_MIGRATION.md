# Gym Subscription System Migration & Overhaul

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive overhaul of the gym subscription system from a generic `customer-subscriptions` API to a gym-specific `gym-subscriptions` API architecture.

## Migration Summary

### What Was Changed

#### Database Schema
- **Old**: `CustomerSubscription` table with generic naming
- **New**: `GymMemberSubscription` table with gym-specific semantics
- **Table Name**: `GymMemberSubscription` (Prisma model) → `"GymMemberSubscription"` (PostgreSQL table)
- **Key Field Changes**:
  - `customerId` → `memberId` (more semantic for gym context)
  - `CustomerSubscriptionStatus` → `GymMemberSubscriptionStatus` (enum)

#### Backend APIs
- **Old**: `/api/v1/customer-subscriptions/*` endpoints (REMOVED)
- **New**: `/api/v1/gym/subscriptions/*` endpoints (gym-specific)
- **Updated Services**: All backend services now use `GymMemberSubscription` model

#### Frontend Migration
- **Old**: `customerSubscriptions` data field in User interface (REMOVED)
- **New**: `gymSubscriptions` data field exclusively used
- **API Client**: Updated to use gym-subscriptions endpoints only
- **Hooks**: All subscription hooks now use gym-specific APIs

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Semantic Clarity**: Table and field names now clearly indicate gym-specific purpose
2. **Business Context**: APIs are organized under `/gym/` prefix for better separation
3. **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth for subscription data
4. **Type Safety**: Gym-specific enums and types provide better validation

## Database Schema

### GymMemberSubscription Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."GymMemberSubscription" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "tenantId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "branchId" TEXT,
    "memberId" TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Was: customerId
    "membershipPlanId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "status" "GymMemberSubscriptionStatus" NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE',
    "startDate" DATE NOT NULL,
    "endDate" DATE NOT NULL,
    "price" DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
    "currency" TEXT DEFAULT 'PHP',
    "usageData" JSONB,
    "cancelledAt" TIMESTAMP(3),
    "cancellationReason" TEXT,
    "cancellationNotes" TEXT,
    "autoRenew" BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    "nextBillingDate" DATE,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
    
    CONSTRAINT "GymMemberSubscription_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

### Status Enum

```sql
CREATE TYPE "public"."GymMemberSubscriptionStatus" AS ENUM (
    'ACTIVE',
    'INACTIVE', 
    'SUSPENDED',
    'CANCELLED',
    'EXPIRED',
    'PENDING_ACTIVATION'
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Gym Subscriptions API (`/api/v1/gym/subscriptions/`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/stats` | Get subscription statistics for tenant |
| `GET` | `/{memberId}` | Get current subscription for member |
| `GET` | `/{memberId}/history` | Get subscription history for member |
| `GET` | `/{memberId}/transactions` | Get member transactions |
| `POST` | `/{memberId}/renew` | Renew membership for member |
| `POST` | `/{memberId}/cancel` | Cancel membership for member |

### Example API Response

```json
{
  "subscription": {
    "id": "sub_123",
    "memberId": "member_456",
    "membershipPlanId": "plan_789",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "startDate": "2025-01-01",
    "endDate": "2025-02-01",
    "price": 1200.00,
    "currency": "PHP",
    "membershipPlan": {
      "id": "plan_789",
      "name": "Basic Monthly",
      "duration": 30,
      "type": "MONTHLY"
    },
    "member": {
      "id": "member_456",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Updated Data Flow

```typescript
// Frontend User Interface (types/index.ts)
interface User {
  id: string;
  // ... other fields
  gymSubscriptions: GymSubscription[];  // NEW: replaced customerSubscriptions
}

// API Hook Usage
const { data: subscriptions } = useGymMemberSubscriptions(memberId);
const { data: stats } = useGymSubscriptionStats();
```

### Key Frontend Changes

1. **User Interface**: Removed `customerSubscriptions`, added `gymSubscriptions`
2. **Member Card Component**: Updated to use `gymSubscriptions` exclusively
3. **Members Page**: New `useGymMembersWithSubscriptions` hook for integrated data
4. **Modal Components**: Updated to reference `gymSubscriptions`
5. **API Client**: Removed legacy customer-subscriptions client

## Migration Process Completed

### Backend Changes ✅
- [x] Renamed `CustomerSubscription` → `GymMemberSubscription` in Prisma schema
- [x] Updated all service classes to use new model
- [x] Updated enum names for better semantics
- [x] Created fresh database migration
- [x] Updated seed file with new model

### Frontend Changes ✅  
- [x] Removed all `customer-subscriptions` API references
- [x] Updated User interface to use `gymSubscriptions`
- [x] Updated member card component
- [x] Created gym-specific hooks and API clients
- [x] Updated modal components
- [x] Cleared frontend caches

### Database Changes ✅
- [x] Cleaned up old migration files (moved to `migrations-backup/`)
- [x] Created fresh schema migration: `20250815202113_fresh_schema_with_gym_member_subscriptions`
- [x] Verified database structure with proper table names
- [x] Seeded database with new schema

## Testing & Verification

### Completed Verifications

1. **Backend API Endpoints**:
   - ✅ Legacy customer-subscriptions endpoints return 404 (properly removed)
   - ✅ New gym-subscriptions endpoints are available (require auth)
   - ✅ Database seeding completed successfully with new schema

2. **Database Structure**:
   - ✅ `GymMemberSubscription` table created correctly
   - ✅ Proper foreign key relationships established
   - ✅ Indexes and constraints applied

3. **Data Migration**:
   - ✅ Seed data created with realistic subscription scenarios
   - ✅ 147 users created across 2 tenants with varied subscription statuses
   - ✅ Branch-specific subscription associations working

### Test Credentials

The system includes comprehensive test data:
- **Super Admin**: admin@creatives-saas.com / SuperAdmin123!
- **Gym Owners**: owner@muscle-mania.com, owner@chakara.com
- **Sample Members**: Various test members with different subscription statuses

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Data Consistency**
- Single source of truth for subscription data
- Eliminated dual API calls that caused count discrepancies
- Proper gym/tenant context filtering

### 2. **Semantic Clarity** 
- Table name `GymMemberSubscription` clearly indicates purpose
- Field `memberId` instead of generic `customerId`
- Gym-specific status enum values

### 3. **Architecture Improvement**
- Clean separation of gym-specific APIs under `/gym/` prefix
- Removed generic customer-subscriptions abstraction
- Better type safety with gym-specific models

### 4. **Frontend Consistency**
- All components now use `gymSubscriptions` uniformly
- Consistent data structure across the application
- Eliminated subscription count inconsistencies

## Future Considerations

1. **Multi-Business Support**: The architecture can be extended for other business types (coffee shops, ecommerce) with their own specific subscription models

2. **Branch-Level Subscriptions**: The current model supports branch-specific subscriptions for multi-location gyms

3. **Subscription Analytics**: The new structure provides better foundation for gym-specific reporting and analytics

4. **API Versioning**: Future API changes can be versioned while maintaining the gym-specific structure

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:

1. **Database**: Restore from `migrations-backup/` directory
2. **Frontend**: The legacy API files are removed, but git history contains them
3. **Backend**: Previous service implementations are in git history

However, rollback is **not recommended** as it would reintroduce the data consistency issues that this migration resolved.
