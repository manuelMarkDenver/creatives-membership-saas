## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Agent Rules
- **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE MAKING CHANGES**: Never modify files, run commands, or make schema changes without explicit user approval first

## Development Environment

### Quick Start (Host-Based Development)
```bash
# Database in Docker, Frontend/Backend on host
./scripts/dev-start.sh

# Or manual 3-terminal setup
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres
cd backend && npm run start:dev
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Port Management
- **Frontend**: Always run on port 3000. Kill any process using it if needed.
- **Backend**: Always run on port 5000. Kill any process using it if needed.

### Production Infrastructure
- **Backend**: Railway.com (‚Ç±250/month) - NestJS + PostgreSQL (149+ seeded users)
- **Frontend**: Vercel.com (free) - Next.js with SSR compatibility
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL with business units and gym subscriptions
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for member photos
- **Total Cost**: ‚Ç±250/month (bootstrap-friendly)
- **URLs**: https://happy-respect-production.up.railway.app (backend), Vercel deployment (frontend)

## Code Style Guidelines

### Backend (NestJS/TypeScript)
- **Imports**: NestJS imports first, then relative imports
- **Naming**: PascalCase for classes/services, camelCase for methods/properties
- **Error handling**: Use NestJS exceptions (BadRequestException, NotFoundException, etc.)
- **DTOs**: Use class-validator decorators and class-transformer
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript with some relaxed rules (noImplicitAny: false)
- **Formatting**: Single quotes, trailing commas (Prettier)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, semantic table naming (GymMemberSubscription)

### Frontend (Next.js/React/TypeScript)
- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **Imports**: Use path aliases (@/*)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with class-variance-authority
- **State**: Zustand stores for business logic, React Query for server state
- **UI**: Radix UI components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Performance**: Zustand stores eliminate re-render loops (< 3 renders per operation)
- **SSR Compatibility**: Client components for third-party libraries (react-toastify)
- **API Structure**: Business-specific endpoints (`/api/v1/gym/*`, `/api/v1/business-units/*`)

### General
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules (ignore during builds for MVP)
- **Formatting**: Prettier (single quotes, trailing commas)
- **No comments**: Avoid adding comments unless explicitly requested
- **Security**: Never expose secrets, use environment variables
- **API Structure**: Business-specific endpoints (`/api/v1/gym/*`, `/api/v1/business-units/*`)
- **Database**: Multi-tenant with business units (shared schema, tenant isolation)
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control (SUPER_ADMIN, OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF, GYM_MEMBER)

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with comprehensive RBAC
- **Global Roles**: SUPER_ADMIN, OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF (platform-level)
- **Business Roles**: GYM_MEMBER, GYM_TRAINER, etc. (business-specific)
- **Guards**: Route-level protection with automatic redirects
- **Session Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
- **Branch Access**: Role-based member management per assigned branches
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents orphaned profiles and role conflicts

### State Management
- **Zustand Stores**: Business units, gym subscriptions, API caching, tenant context
- **React Query**: Server state management with optimistic updates
- **Performance**: < 3 re-renders per operation (eliminated 20+ re-render loops)
- **Real-time Updates**: Query invalidation for immediate UI refresh
- **Store Architecture**: Modular stores with error handling and loading states

### Database Design
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Shared database with tenantId isolation
- **Business Units Model**: Flexible LOCATION, CHANNEL, DEPARTMENT, FRANCHISE types
- **Semantic Naming**: GymMemberSubscription, BusinessUnit, SaasSubscription
- **Migration Strategy**: Prisma migrations with comprehensive seeding (149+ users)
- **Schema Changes**: Always use Prisma migrations, never prisma push
- **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth with proper foreign key relationships
- **Paid Mode Toggle**: Subscription enforcement per tenant with trial management
- **Data Integrity**: Unique constraints, transaction safety, orphaned profile prevention

### RBAC Use Cases & Implementation

#### Global Roles (Platform-Level)
- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full platform access, all tenants, system administration
- **OWNER**: Full tenant access, all branches, user management, billing
- **MANAGER**: Branch-specific management, staff supervision, client management
- **STAFF**: Limited operations, client check-in, basic client administration
- **CLIENT**: End users/customers across all business types (gym members, coffee customers, e-commerce customers, etc.)

#### Business Roles (Business-Specific)
- **GYM_MEMBER**: Gym-specific client with access to gym features
- **GYM_TRAINER**: Member training, workout plans, progress tracking
- **GYM_FRONT_DESK**: Member check-in, basic administration
- **GYM_MAINTENANCE**: Equipment maintenance, facility management

#### Access Patterns
- **Owner Access**: All branches within their tenant ‚úÖ
- **Manager Access**: Assigned branches only (via GymUserBranch table) ‚úÖ
- **Staff Access**: Assigned branches only (via GymUserBranch table) ‚úÖ
- **Client Access**: Their own profile and assigned branches ‚úÖ

#### RBAC Implementation Status
- **Global Roles**: SUPER_ADMIN, OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF, CLIENT ‚úÖ
- **Business Roles**: GYM_MEMBER, GYM_TRAINER, etc. ‚úÖ
- **Branch Assignment**: GymUserBranch table ‚úÖ
- **Owner All-Access**: Implemented in RBAC guard ‚úÖ
- **Manager Branch Assignment**: Via GymUserBranch ‚úÖ
- **Role Conflicts**: Resolved with clean CLIENT role separation ‚úÖ

#### User Creation Flow
- **Automatic**: `POST /gym/members` creates User (CLIENT role) + GymMemberProfile
- **Manual**: `POST /users` creates business-agnostic users
- **Role Assignment**: CLIENT global role for all end users, business-specific roles in profiles
