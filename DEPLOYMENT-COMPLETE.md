     "category": "FITNESS",
     "ownerFirstName": "John",
     "ownerLastName": "Doe",
     "ownerEmail": "test@example.com"
   }
   ```

2. **Login with Temporary Password**

   - ✅ Create membership plan (non-dismissible)
   - ✅ Add member or skip (optional)

4. **Verify Access to Dashboard**

### API Testing

```bash
# Check onboarding status
curl -X GET https://happy-respect-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/onboarding-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# Expected Response:

  ]
}
```
