# Photo Upload Implementation - Fixed & Enhanced

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Fixed API URL Configuration Issue**
- **Problem**: Frontend was calling `http://localhost:3000/api/v1` instead of `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`
- **Solution**: Updated all components to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` with fallback to `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`

### 2. **Implemented Temporary Photo Upload Workflow**
- **Your Request**: Store photos locally during editing and only upload to Supabase when member is actually saved
- **Solution**: Added `temporaryMode` to PhotoUpload component with local file storage

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Enhanced PhotoUpload Component
```typescript
interface PhotoUploadProps {
  memberId?: string;
  currentPhotoUrl?: string | null;
  onUploadComplete?: (photoUrl: string | null) => void;
  onUploadError?: (error: string) => void;
  onFileChange?: (file: File | null, previewUrl: string | null) => void; // NEW
  disabled?: boolean;
  className?: string;
  temporaryMode?: boolean; // NEW - enables temporary workflow
}
```

### Two Photo Upload Modes

#### 1. **Temporary Mode** (New - Used in Add Member Modal)
```typescript
<PhotoUpload
  temporaryMode={true}
  currentPhotoUrl={formData.photoPreviewUrl}
  onFileChange={handlePhotoChange}
  className="w-full max-w-sm"
/>
```

**How it works**:
- ✅ Files are stored locally as `File` objects
- ✅ Previews are generated using `FileReader.readAsDataURL()`
- ✅ No immediate upload to server
- ✅ Photo is uploaded to Supabase only when "Add Member" is clicked
- ✅ Help text shows: "Photo will be saved when you save the member"

#### 2. **Immediate Mode** (Existing - Used in Member Info Modal)
```typescript
<PhotoUpload
  memberId={member.id}
  currentPhotoUrl={member.photoUrl}
  onUploadComplete={(url) => handlePhotoUpdate(url)}
/>
```

**How it works**:
- ✅ Photos upload immediately to Supabase upon selection
- ✅ Real-time feedback and error handling
- ✅ Used for editing existing members
- ✅ Help text shows: "Photo will be saved immediately after upload"

## 🚀 Updated Workflows

### Add Member Modal Workflow
```
1. User selects photo → Stored locally + preview shown
2. User fills member details → Photo still local
3. User clicks "Add Member" → Member created in DB
4. Photo automatically uploaded to Supabase with memberID
5. Success notification shown
```

### Member Info Modal Workflow  
```
1. User enters edit mode → Camera icons appear
2. User selects new photo → Immediately uploads to Supabase
3. Photo URL updated in database + UI
4. Success notification shown
```
